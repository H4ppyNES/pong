# Retro Game Lab Camp: Retro Pong!

## Introduction
Welcome to **Retro Pong!** üïπÔ∏è  
In this game, we'll re-create the retro classic Pong ‚Äî but with a modern twist!  
You'll learn how to make:

- your **own Sprite kinds** 
- use **functions** to keep code neat 
- detect **sprite overlaps** 
- track **scores for two players**.






## Creating a Background!

Let's start with the most basic part of *every* project, the background!

### Setting the Background

- :tree: From ``||scene:Scene||``, drag out ``||scene:set background image to []||`` and snap it inside your ``||loops:on start||`` container.  
- :mouse pointer: Click the [] to open the Image Editor and draw a cool background (or paste one like a blue court!).  

- :lightbulb: Sensei Tip ‚Äî You can press **Gallery** and pick any preset to make your background colorful fast!








## Making Sprite Kinds

Normally, MakeCode Arcade has sprite kinds like **Player**, **Enemy**, and **Projectile**.  

But in Pong, we need our own kinds: **Blue**, **Red**, **Ball**, and the **Goals**!

### Let's make the custom Sprite Kinds!

- :paper plane: Find the ``||sprites: set mySprite to img [] of Kind [Player]||`` inside of the ``||sprites: Sprites||`` menu and place it onto your ``||loops: on start||`` container.

- :mouse pointer: Where it says ``||sprites: Kind [Player]||``, select the **drop down menu** and press **Add a new Kind...**

- :keyboard: Create 3 new Sprite Kinds: **Ball**, **RedGoal**, **BlueGoal** 

These create *new categories* for our sprites so we can detect which one overlaps which.  

You'll use these kinds in dropdowns inside the ``||sprites:on overlap||`` blocks later.








## Step 1: Player Paddle (Blue)
- :paper plane: From ``||sprites:Sprites||``, grab ``||sprites:set mySprite to []||``.  

- :mouse pointer: Draw a **blue vertical paddle** (about 8√ó32 pixels).    

- :tree: Add ``||sprites:set bluePaddle position to x(8) y(60)||`` under it.  

### Make It Move
- :game controller: Add ``||controller:move bluePaddle with buttons||``.  
- :mouse pointer: Change movement speed to vx = 0, vy = 50.  

Since vx = 0, the paddle only moves **up and down**, perfect for Pong!








## Step 2: Enemy Paddle (Red)
Now for the **AI paddle** on the right side!  
- :paper plane: Create another ``||sprites:set mySprite to []||``, draw a **red vertical paddle**, rename to ``||variables:redPaddle||``, and set kind to ||sprites:Red||.  

- :tree: Add ||sprites:set redPaddle position to x(152) y(60)||.  

Then add:

set redPaddle velocity to **(0, 50)**  

set redPaddle bounce on wall to **(true)**  

Now it moves up and down automatically and bounces off the screen edges ‚Äî no controller needed!



## Step 3: The Goals
The goals are invisible "walls" that detect when the ball passes a side.  

### Red Goal (Left Side)
- :paper plane: Create a sprite (tiny vertical rectangle) for the red goal.  

Rename it to ``||variables:redGoal||`` and set its kind to ``||sprites:redGoal||``.  

- :tree: Set position x = 0.  

### Blue Goal (Right Side)
:paper plane: Create another sprite for the blue goal.  
Rename it to ``||variables:blueGoal||`` and set its kind to ``||sprites:blueGoal||`` .  
:tree: Set position x = 160.  

These detect when each player scores!

 

## Step 4: The Ball Function ‚öΩ
We'll use a **function** to create and launch the ball.  
:functions: Go to ``||functions:Functions||`` ‚Üí **Make a Function** ‚Üí name it **createBall**.  

Inside the function, add:  
- :paper plane:``||sprites:set ballSprite to []||`` and draw a small **white circle** (about 8√ó8).  
- :paper plane: its kind to ``||sprites:Ball||``.  
- :paper plane:``||sprites:set ballSprite velocity to vx(50) vy(50)||``.  
- :paper plane: ``||sprites:set ballSprite bounce on wall to (true)||``.  

Now your function knows how to make and launch a new ball!

 

## Step 5: Start the Game
Inside your ``||loops:on start||`` container:  

- :info: Add:

``||info:info.player1.setScore(0)||``

``||info:info.player2.setScore(0)||``

- :computer: Then call your new function:

- :computer: ``||createBall()||``

Now both scores start at zero and a new ball appears.

 

## Step 6: Overlaps ‚Äî The Magic of Collision üéØ
We'll use overlaps to bounce the ball and score points.

### Blue Paddle Overlap

:paper plane: Add ``||sprites:on overlap||`` with **Blue** and **Ball**.  

Inside it:

``||logic:otherSprite.vx = otherSprite.vx * -1||``
``||loops:pause(500)||``  

This bounces the ball and slows it briefly.

### Red Paddle Overlap

- :paper plane: Add another overlap: **Red** and **Ball**.  

Inside:

``||logic:otherSprite.vx = otherSprite.vx * -1||``
``||loops:pause(500)||``  



### Red Goal Overlap (Left Side)

- :paper plane: Add overlap **redGoal** and **Ball**.  

Inside:

``||info:info.player2.changeScoreBy(1)||``  
``||logic:otherSprite.vx = otherSprite.vx * -1||``  
``||loops:pause(500)||``

Now **Player 2 (Red)** scores a point when the ball hits the left wall.

### Blue Goal Overlap (Right Side)

- :paper plane: Add overlap **blueGoal** and **Ball**.  

Inside:

``||info:info.player1.changeScoreBy(1)||``  
``||logic:otherSprite.vx = otherSprite.vx * -1||``
``||loops:pause(500)||``

Now **Player 1 (Blue)** scores when the ball hits the right wall.

 

## Step 7: Test and Tweak
Press **Play ‚ñ∂** and check:  
‚úÖ Do both paddles move correctly?  
‚úÖ Does the ball bounce off walls and paddles?  
‚úÖ Do scores increase on each goal hit?

If your ball gets stuck, make sure you called createBall() inside on start.


## Step 8: Add Personality ‚ú®

Try these challenge ideas!  
üéµ Play a sound each time the ball bounces: ``||music:play sound (ba-ding)||``  
üî• Make the ball faster after every bounce!  
üé® Redraw paddles with pixel art flair!  
üß† Add a "win" screen when a player reaches 5 points.

## üéâ You Did It!
You just built **Retro Pong!**  
You learned:
- How to create **custom sprite kinds**
- How to use **functions** to respawn objects
- How to use **sprite overlaps** for scoring and collision
- How to track **two players' scores**

Now challenge yourself ‚Äî can you make it **two-player** using another controller? üòé
